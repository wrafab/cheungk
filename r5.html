<h1> Week 5: 3D Printing/Scanning</h1>
      <p> . What are the design rules and limitations for the MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers?
        <br>
        Size is a big limitation for the MakerBot, but other than that, you can really make anything.  There are certain limitations on how
        fine a #D printed object can be and the texture of the surface on the MakerSpace will take a long time. The triangular template is also a
        limitation for the STL file.
        <br>
        What type of 3D printing process does the MakerBot Replicator use? 
        <br>
        The MakerBot uses the additive process.  
        <br>
        What are the advantages to this type of printer versus the FormLabs printer? 
        <br>
        The MakerBot printer is relatively cheaper. However, the FormLab printer is advanced in its detailed printing.  The MakerBot can print larger objects and for the common use.

      <p> I combined a A-10 stl file from ThingVerse to my scanned head on Meshmixed. I made my head solid after cutting off everything below my neck.
        Then I saved it as a stl file and then sent it to the Makerbot application to adjust the size and support.In the end, I used a USB and printed my object at the printer. </p>

      <p> I thought, what object can I make that can not be made subtractively, something with two sides. While an additive printer can create an object with details on all four sides, a subtractive can only make one side at a time. 
        So I came up with a half sphere with a hole on the flat side. </p>

     <p> A basic design that is inspired from headphones. Peter was scanned with his arms raised at an angle. That creates a hanger for headphones. </p>
