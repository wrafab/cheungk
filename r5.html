<h1> Week 5: 3D Printing/Scanning</h1>
      <p> . What are the design rules and limitations for the MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers?
        <br>
        Size is a big limitation for the MakerBot, but other than that, you can really make anything.  There are certain limitations on how
        fine a #D printed object can be and the texture of the surface on the MakerSpace will take a long time.  
        <br>
        What type of 3D printing process does the MakerBot Replicator use? 
        <br>
        The MakerBot uses the additive process.  
        <br>
        What are the advantages to this type of printer versus the FormLabs printer?
