<h1> Week 1: Principles of Digital Fabrication, Design Challenges and HTML </h1>
      <br>
      My interest in Digital Fabrication come from nothing other than computer games. I've been interested in designing objects in the digital world, then
       bringing it to the real world. It just sounds cool. My interest futured when I heard that 3D printed objects are used in military technology. 
      <br>
      <p> The first class of Digital Fabrication was dedicate to group challenges.  We were given a few challenges, such as buiding a structure that could prevent a golf ball from touching the ground 
        using straws and building the tallest structure using newspaper.  I had a group with Tim and Peter.  We approached the challenges with planning first, we had a notepad
        to draw our designs, then we executed our plan. However, all our plans failed.
