<h1> Week 1: Principles of Digital Fabrication, Design Challenges and HTML </h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> The first class of Digital Fabrication was dedicate to group challenges.  We were given a few challenges, such as buiding a structure that could prevent a golf ball from touching the ground 
        using straws and building the tallest structure using newspaper.  I had a group with Tim and Peter.  We approached the challenges with planning first, we had a notepad
        to draw our designs, then we executed our plan. all our plans failed in the end however.
