<h1> About Me </hr>
<p> As you saw in my home page, I am Kai Cheung, graduating class of 2019 and I am from Hong Kong. I don't have a profession to put here, so let's talk sports.  
I am an avid fan in football (or as Americans call if "soccer") and hockey.  I was a fan of Manchester United since I was six years old, and I recently started supporting the Toronto Maple Leafs after learning about the sport in school.
I also love to game, only Playstation 4 and PC games.  Hit me up on Steam, it is linked below.
